# Modern ConvNetJS

It is a project trying to reimplement [ConvNetJS](https://github.com/karpathy/convnetjs) with modern styles (ECMAScript6, functional programming), making it's code shorter, more readable for beginners and easier to extend.

It's sure that we should never expect a neural network training in the browser doing a big deal, but it's useful for presentation and understanding.

It is still under developing. 

Following is a short introduction to ConvNetJS itself:

ConvNetJS is a Javascript implementation of Neural networks, together with nice browser-based demos. It currently supports:

- Common **Neural Network modules** (fully connected layers, non-linearities)
- Classification (SVM/Softmax) and Regression (L2) **cost functions**
- Ability to specify and train **Convolutional Networks** that process images
- An experimental **Reinforcement Learning** module, based on Deep Q Learning
